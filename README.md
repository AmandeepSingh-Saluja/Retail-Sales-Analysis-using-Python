# 🛍️ Retail Sales Analysis using Python 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end analysis of retail sales data. It begins with data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Python** and concludes with the creation of an **interactive dashboard in Power BI**.

The goal is to uncover key business insights such as monthly sales performance, top-selling categories, and region-wise trends to support strategic decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Order Date`
- `Product`
